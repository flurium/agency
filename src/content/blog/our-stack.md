# The tech stack we bet on and you should too

The stacks change during the time, so we want to make sure our projects can keep competitive state as long as possible.
As a business we want to provide the best value for situation,
so we will consider some paths of stack depending on requirements.

Because if we do use a good and performant, we should explain to our clients why it's important.
Or we should just use the fastest to develop tool.

# Frontend

React is popular, but I hate it and there is better alternatives.
The problems with React: one of the slowest, drama, too much goes into fullstack, messy.
So I am gonna bet on one of the new generation frameworks, such as: Svelte, Solid, Qwick, Astro.

I picked **Svelte** and SvelteKit as meta framework.
Solid is fast, but Solid Start (their meta framework) isn't production ready.
Qwick is very yong, but has company behind (which is good for developing).
But Svelte is super, it's fast and clean to write, when you learnt it.
Svelte has company behind ther back - Vercel, as a result it gets a lot of updates and latest features from Next.js like ISR.
Svelte is performant and small, has certain structure, so it's easier to get into new another project.
